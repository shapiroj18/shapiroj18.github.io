project: screenshot-helper

## Background
Sometimes it is nice, rather than having a million tags open to be able to just screenshot and remember where you wanted to go. It would be nice to have an app that allowed you to create a keystroke (mobile, but potentially desktop as well) where you can simply screenshot and it generates a qr code or short url for your library. These could also be saved with some level of metadata, like website title, self-created descriptors, etc.

## Usage
Probably best experience in mobile, but could be applicable to desktop as well.

## Development
