## Background
I remember writing my thesis in organic chemistry for undergrad how difficult it was to use placeholders for all of my numbered compounds and references. It would be great to build a program that could automate the naming and references for papers.

Of note, this may already exist. For example, [konwerter](http://piti.exroot.org/konwerter/about/index.html) seems to do this for compounds with Latex.

However, this still may be needed for word docs, google docs, etc.
