project: best-brewery
author: Jonathan Shapiro

## Background
When I'm somewhere new, I'd like to easily find the best brewery and/or highest rated beer at a brewery near my location. Currently, I go to untappd maps, filter for breweries and individually look at each one's rating.

## Development
Untappd has an [open API](https://untappd.com/api/docs) that includes a [brewery search](https://untappd.com/api/docs#brewerysearch)

## Ideas
* Include geolocation or ability to put in a specific location, then have an input for distance willing to travel
