project: shareable-bookmarks

## Background
I save quite a few bookmarks that I really like going back to, sorted by things like "social justice," "blogs," "music," and even "for fun." I mean, who wouldn't want to have quick access to [Blob Opera](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/blob-opera/AAHWrq360NcGbw?cp=e30.%2Fartsandculture.google.com%2Fexperiment%2Fblob-opera%2FAAHWrq360NcGbw%3Fcp%3De30.)?

It got me thinking that other folks must put time and effort into their saved bookmarks as well, so why not create a platform to share it?

## Usage
Probably best as an integration to slack, discord, a website browser extention, etc.

## Possible Names
"Shookmarks" and "Rediscover" come to mind.

## Development
* Mozilla API [bookmarks.get()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks/get)

## Additional Thoughts
* This could be used with the angle of social media for groups / organizations
* Can be used to promote activism/stories, though the opposite can be true and can always run into the issue of hate groups becoming popular on this type of platform
* Can "follow" folks
