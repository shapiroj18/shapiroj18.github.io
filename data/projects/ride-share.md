## Background
Getting out of an airport there are often a lot of folks trying to get rides through rideshare apps. Wouldn't it be nice to carpool with them even if they were strangers and save overall money?

It would be great to have an app that would allow you to find folks in your area also looking to share a ride and match based on where you're trying to go.

Clearly, safety would be a factor with an app like this so that must be thought about pretty seriously if this ever goes to production.
