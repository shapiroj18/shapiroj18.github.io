## Background
I've found that Spotify's algorithms push me primarily to songs, rather than whole albums and artists. It would be great to have a platform that allows for discovery of new albums that music critics decide. For example, what if you could get radio artist's top albums that you love? Or go for the straightforward Pitchfork's [best albums overall](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/best-albums-2021/) or [best new music](https://pitchfork.com/best/)?

## Development
* It would be great to search by genre, similar artists or albums, etc.
* A UI that includes scrolling albums with metadata and/or a jukebox would be great
