## Background
I liked the idea of sending messaged vis a vis AIM through my shell. Looks like it has been done quite a bit before, but sent me into interesting forays into learning about networking and protocols.

There are quite a few [instant messaging protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols) (also other [network protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_network_protocols) in general), of which a few caught my attention. For example, [matrix](https://matrix.org/) is an interesting one but alraedy has many [clients](https://matrix.org/clients) (including terminal-based / command line ones). Similarly, [Tox](https://toktok.ltd/index.html) has a list of [clients](https://toktok.ltd/integrations.html).

## Random Thoughts
* It would be interesting to see what building a protocol from scratch is like.
* Webhooks would be useful here, but then you need to use internet-based protocols
