# Personal Site

## Notes
* Built using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## To-Do:
* Write up list in google docs, have site access it via api and then parse as title, short description, scratch. Automatically make `.js` files with scratch?
* Put header in a general area? Maybe `_document.js`?
* Add site analytics
* Add site SEO
* Add [flow-field](https://github.com/romellogoodman/flow-field.js)
