It would be great to build a program that could automate the naming and references for papers.\n\nOf note, this may already exist. For example, [konwerter](http://piti.exroot.org/konwerter/about/index.html) seems to do this for compounds with Latex.\n\nHowever, this still may be needed for word docs, google docs, etc."}},"__N_SSG":true}
