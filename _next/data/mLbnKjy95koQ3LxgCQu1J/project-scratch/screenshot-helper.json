{"pageProps":{"projectData":{"project":"screenshot-helper","frontMatter":{"project":"screenshot-helper","author":"Jonathan Shapiro"},"content":"\n## Background\nSometimes it is nice, rather than having a million tags open to be able to just screenshot and remember where you wanted to go. It would be nice to have an app that allowed you to create a keystroke (mobile, but potentially desktop as well) where you can simply screenshot and it generates a qr code or short url for your library. These could also be saved with some level of metadata, like website title, self-created descriptors, etc.\n\n## Usage\nProbably best experience in mobile, but could be applicable to desktop as well.\n\n## Development\n* Screencapture APIs\n  * https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/79635\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
