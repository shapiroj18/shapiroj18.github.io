For example, I have a [basic program](https://github.com/shapiroj18/weather-app) that send me the weather each day, which is currently running as a cron job on a Raspberry Pi.\n\nI noticed that GitHub Actions has an option to [schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) CI runs, so why not use that architecture to run basic jobs?\n\n## Development\nThis project is currently [being built](https://github.com/shapiroj18/gh-cron-automation), and I hope to write a blog post for this!\n\nOverall I would like to do something like both prove out the concept with a super simple automated job (which you can see [here](https://github.com/shapiroj18/gh-cron-automation/blob/main/.github/workflows/scheduled-test-time.yml)), as well as something closer to matching a typical batch job.\n\nWith regards to the batch job, it would be great to do something like:\n```\nGet dataset from REST API or other >> Upload to data repository like PostgreSQL using Node SQL ORM >> Visualize with D3.js >> Email report with Node\n```"}},"__N_SSG":true}
