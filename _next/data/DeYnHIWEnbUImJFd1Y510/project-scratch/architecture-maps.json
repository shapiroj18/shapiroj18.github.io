It often times requires legacy knowledge, understanding of the framework, languages and other tools used, and even the style of individual developers.\n\nI would love to be able to map projects to give some version of an overall visualized diagram or clues to where to jump into the codebase.\n\n## Example Thoughts\n1. For python, you can look at import paths so that you can find the \"root\" code and then follow the path until you have an understanding of the project. This can be used to read a codebase (or a specific section), or graphically represent the project layout of the project.\n1. How directories are nested, or how projects are layered in general can be artistically represented. Wouldn't it be cool to make unique, pretty depictions of a repository?"}},"__N_SSG":true}
